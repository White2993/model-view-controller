# model-view-controller

If at first you don't succeed, try, and try, and try, and try, and try again, then fail.

These last two weeks have been exceptionally hard, and this assignment even moreso.

I did my absolute hardest on this project, and not only did I not get it done, as a cherry on top github didn't save my original README, so I'm writing it again.

It's frustrating to not understand something in class, and then go home and comb over documentation I still don't understand.
But I'm still excited to come to class and work on something new for some reason. I digress.

Even though I've let myself down, and 90% of the work I did was just fixing error after error, I guess there's a silver lining in that.
